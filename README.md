# Movie Trailer Website

**Movie Trailer Website** is a project that has been written for **Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program**.

In this project, the webpage will display three of my favorite movies that I have selected. When the image of the movie is clicked, the corresponding movie trailer shall display via YouTube.
